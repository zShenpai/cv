  <h2>The lessons I take</h2>
  <p>
    So, first of all the lessons that i use is a paid online lesson (its pretty cheap) and I'm making this website by the course's guidance. It's known as udemy.com I highly recommend using it cuz it's pretty cheap.

  <h2>The app I use for coding</h2>
  <p>
    It's known as <em>Atom</em>, it's just like your normal coding app but, whats appealing in it is the packages that it offers for free. These packages are really useful for coding and i recommend downloading them. A few packages that i use are
    <br>atom-beautify <br>atom-ternjs <br>emmet <br>These are very good packages for coding and i highly recommend getting them
